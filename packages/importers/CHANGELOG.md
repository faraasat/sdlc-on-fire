# @sdlc-on-fire/importers

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Walked the six v0.1 definition-of-done items by hand against the built binary,
  and fixed what that found — none of it visible to the test suite, which was
  green at 1340 tests throughout.

  - `sdlc skills doctor` and `sdlc skills compile` now exist. The Claude Code
    compiler, the capability table and the doctor had all shipped with tests, but
    nothing ever wired them to a command, so a user could not compile a skill at
    all.
  - Approving an agent's restated understanding now requires a human at a
    terminal. `echo approve --as agent` used to succeed and write "decided by:
    agent (human)" into the record — the one gate that breaks the
    agent-approves-itself circularity was satisfiable by the agent.
  - `sdlc advance` no longer deletes hand-written frontmatter from a git-tracked
    card. It serialized only the schema's known keys, so an ordinary transition
    destroyed every other field — including the `verify:` command the next gate
    then demanded by name.
  - `sdlc init` brings the database up instead of reporting success and deferring
    it, so a machine where the runtime cannot start says so at the setup step.
  - Compiled skills use the substitutions Claude Code actually performs
    (`$ARGUMENTS[N]`), and `arguments:` is emitted in the shape it actually reads.
    Both were silently wrong: the skill loaded and did nothing with its arguments.
  - `sdlc verify` names the remedy when evidence falls back to exit-code-only,
    instead of leaving a user at 0.6 confidence with no idea why.
  - New `@sdlc-on-fire/importers`: the parser port, tool-independent IR, and
    transactional dependency-ordered writer with `external_ref` idempotency.
    Groundwork for the migration path; no CLI command wires it yet.
